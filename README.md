🍏 Fruit Disease Prediction 🍎
This project leverages machine learning and computer vision to detect and classify diseases in fruits based on leaf images. By analyzing patterns, colors, and textures, the model helps farmers and agricultural experts identify infections early, improving crop health and yield.

🚀 Features
✅ Image-based fruit disease classification
✅ Deep learning model (CNN-based) for accurate predictions
✅ User-friendly interface for easy image uploads
✅ Real-time detection with high accuracy
✅ Dataset sourced from agricultural research institutes and online repositories

🛠️ Tech Stack
🔹 Python (TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV)
🔹 Flask/FastAPI for backend API
🔹 Streamlit for interactive UI (optional)
🔹 Jupyter Notebook for model training

📌 How It Works
Upload an image of a fruit leaf.
The model processes the image and extracts key features.
It predicts the disease (or confirms a healthy leaf).
Displays the result along with possible treatment suggestions.
📷 Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images of healthy and diseased fruit leaves, covering multiple fruit types such as apples, bananas, and grapes.

🔥 Future Enhancements
Improve model accuracy with advanced architectures (ResNet, EfficientNet)
Expand dataset to cover more fruit types
Mobile app integration for on-the-go disease detection
